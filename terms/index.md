# Terms of Service

*Last updated: 08/01/2025*

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to [RefractedSMP](https://refractedsmp.net).

When we say “Services”, we mean our websites, including refractedsmp.net and any product created and maintained by RefractedSMP. 

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services. We have specific ownership policies for our product: [RefractedSMP](https://refractedsmp.net)

We may update these Terms of Service ("Terms") in the future. You can track all changes made since August of 2025 [on our TOS Page](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/terms). Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account, restrict access to some of our services, disable features, etc.

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
2. You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Use Restrictions policy](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/restrictions), and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.
3. You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account. Any action on your account is tied back to your account and the account holder.
4. You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/restrictions).
2. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.
3. In order to cancel and stop using our services, please request a cancellation opt out at https://refractedsmp.net/legal/cancellation_optout. You will be un-whitelisted immediately and be removed from the RefractedSMP. If you wish to start playing again you may use your application code to re-apply.

## Modifications to the Service

1. We make a promise to our customers that if the RefractedSMP comes to an end, we will let you know 7 days ahead. Within the 7 days, you may login to your dashboard and and request the archives. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit [statrefracted.instatus.com](statrefracted.instatus.com) to see the status of our Services. We use instatus to provide our status page.
2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, a no-peeking policy, and an HTTPS Encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission via an **forced** HTTPS connection. Please refer to our [Security Overview](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/security) for full details and our [Security Response page](https://report.refractedsmp.net/security) for how to report a security incident or threat.
4. When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that the RefractedSMP may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/privacy) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
  - **To help you with support requests you make.** We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
  - **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.
  - **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-US authority approaches RefractedSMP for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism.
    
5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all companies that share data to us to better personalize your experience. [Shared-Data-List](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/data-sharing)
6. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), RefractedSMP is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms, the [Privacy policy](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/privacy), and [other policies](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use the RefractedSMP’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.
   
## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.
2. The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company’s logos or any Service logos for commercial purposes. Please [email us](legal@refractedsmp.net) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any permissions if you violate these Terms.

## Features and Bugs

We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.


## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the services we provide; investments in security and infrastructure. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.

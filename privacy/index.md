# Privacy policy

*Last updated: August 01 2025*

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy is split into sections. For your convenience, links to each of those sections is as follows:

* Privacy policy
* What we collect and why
* When we access or disclose your information
  Your rights with respect to your information
* How we secure your data
* Data retention
* Location of site and data
* Changes and questions


This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with the RefractedSMP). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.

However, this policy does not cover information about a customer’s end users that RefractedSMP receives from a customer, or otherwise processes on a customer’s behalf, in connection with the services provided by the RefractedSMP to the customer pursuant to an applicable services agreement (including the content of messages of customer end users ("End User Communications")). RefractedSMP processes End User Communications under the instructions of the relevant customer, which is the "data controller" or "business" (or occupies a similar role as defined in applicable privacy laws), as described in the applicable services agreement between such customer and RefractedSMP. RefractedSMP’s obligations as a "data processor" or "service provider" with respect to such information are defined in such services agreement and applicable data protection addendum and are not made part of this policy.

If you are a customer’s end user and you have questions about how your information is collected and processed through the services, please contact the organization who has provided your information to us for more information.

If you are a California resident, please [click here to see our California Notice at Collection](https://RefractedSMP.net/legal/compliance/ccpca), which includes additional disclosures as required by California law.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

### Identity and access

When you sign in via your discord account, we use your discord ID, Profile Picture, and username so we can personalize your myDash or your dashboard. When applying via our google form link. We collect your email address, minecraft username, age, discord ID (Discord Identification Number), Social Media handles, etc. We use this information for you to track your application status via myDash and for us to send you emails about your application.

We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.


### Product interactions

We store on our servers your discord ID, application code, etc. This is so you can use our products as intended. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you request a deletation, we will delete it within 30 days of cancellation.


### Anti-bot assessments

We use [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your RefractedSMP (myDash) accounts and when you fill in certain forms in your dashboard, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides RefractedSMP with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.

### Cookies

We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some analytics.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won’t work and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.

## When we access or disclose your information

**To provide products or services you’ve requested**. We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. You can view the third-party subprocessors we use at [**https://refractedsmp.net/legal/data-sharing**](https://refractedsmp.net/legal/data-sharing).

We may disclose your information at your direction if you integrate a third-party service into your use of our products. For example, we may allow you, at your option, to connect your Gmail account to your account so that you can use your google account to login to your myDash dashboard.

No employee here at our company looks at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access your data if required in order to respond to legal process (see "When required under applicable law" below).

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**When required under applicable law.** RefractedSMP is based in the U.S and all of our minecraft servers are based locally in the U.S

* Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is 37signals’ policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.

## Your rights with respect to your information

At RefractedSMP, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and/or emailing us. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.

In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests.

Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via HTTPS with a safe and secure certificate when transmitted from our servers to your browser. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## Cancellation Requests

To cancel your account, please go to **https://refractedsmp.net/legal/cancellation_optout**.

## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. As long as you keep your account standing and in good hands, we will continue to keep your data until you fill out the cancellation optout request.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. 

## Changes and questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify users.
